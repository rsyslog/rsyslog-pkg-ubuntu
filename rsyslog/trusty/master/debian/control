Description: a rocket-fast system for log processing
 Rsyslog is a multi-threaded implementation of syslogd (a system utility
 providing support for message logging), with features that include:
  * reliable syslog over TCP, SSL/TLS and RELP
  * on-demand disk buffering
  * email alerting
  * writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)
  * permitted sender lists
  * filtering on any part of the syslog message
  * on-the-wire message compression
  * fine-grained output format control
  * failover to backup destinations
  * enterprise-class encrypted syslog relaying
 .
 It is the default syslogd on Debian systems.

         rsyslog (= ${binary:Version})
Description: IP Address Anonimization Module (mmanon).
 The mmanon module permits to anonymize IP addresses. It is a message 
 modification module that actually changes the IP address inside the message, 
 so after calling mmanon, the original message can no longer be obtained. 
 Note that anonymization will break digital signatures on the message, if they exist.

Description: The mmutf8fix module permits to fix invalid UTF-8 sequences. Most often, 
 such invalid sequences result from syslog sources sending in non-UTF character sets, 
 e.g. ISO 8859. As syslog does not have a way to convey the character set information, 
 these sequences are not properly handled.
