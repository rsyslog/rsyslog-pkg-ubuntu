rsyslog (5.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The way rsyslog processes SIGHUP has changed. It no longer does a reload
  of its configuration, but simply closes all open files, which is a much more
  lightweight operation.
  To apply a changed configuration, rsyslogd needs to be restarted now.
  As a consequence, the reload action has been dropped from the init script.

  A new action called "rotate" was added to the init script, which signals
  rsyslogd to close all open files. This new action is used in the rsyslog
  logrotate configuration file.
